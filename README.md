# INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING ON THIS PROJECT 

#### Rule number one of Bangazon Workforce Manager - Nobody but Chaz can update migrations
### Rule number two pf Bangazon Workforce Manager - Nobdy but Chaz can update migrations

Due to some awesome stuff with visual studio - if multiple people add migrations and try and push it to github - were gonna have a bad time. 
If you or anyone you know find any problems/or find something you need to add let Chaz know. He will make the change and push up a new master forthwith. 
This will avoid any migration issues moving forward. 

### Working remotely

If anybody is going to be working on anything remotely this week, PLEASE make your PRs _as detailed as possible_. 
We wont be around each other to quickly get feedback. 
Please leave detailed message about _what_ you did and _why you did it_ 
ALSO - please give a description of the details we should expect when testing your code. "Run it and make sure it works" is not a good response and I will lay the ban hammer down on those PRs. 

If you have any other questions - we're all on slack. If you get stuck or dont know where to go on something let everyone know.
